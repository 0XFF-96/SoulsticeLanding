Please find attached the pitch deck for Soulstice, which outlines a conservative growth potential for the app.

I’d love for the Soulstice MVP to begin with 2–3 core features, centred on a living, animated orb that users can interact with:

1. Real-time Energy Reading (via live orb interaction)

Users press and hold the orb for a few seconds to receive a short, personalised reading. Each reading includes:


Mirror Statement – a concise reflection of their current energy state.

Clarifying Insight – context around what their energy is showing them.

Micro-Action / Anchor – a small step they can take immediately to shift or align.

For example:

Orb Reflection:

	1.	“Your energy feels active, but scattered.”

	2.	“You’re carrying too many open loops in your mind — clarity will come when you focus on one thing at a time.”

  3.	“Today, write down your top 3 priorities and let the rest wait. Your power grows in focus.”



2. Highest Timeline Guidance (for life questions)

Users ask the orb a direct question offering short, impactful guidance designed to realign them with their highest timeline.

Example User Question



“Am I on the right path with my career?”



Orb Response 



1. “Your path is aligned, but you are carrying doubt that isn’t yours.”



2. “The recognition you seek comes not from efforting harder, but from embodying the leader you already are. Your energy is ahead of the system — patience is part of the timing.”



3. “Today, speak one sentence as if you already hold that next role. Words spoken in certainty shift timelines.”



3. Personalised Energetic Reading (via user profile input)

By answering a few questions (including date of birth), users receive a deeper reading outlining their life lessons, key traits, and what alignment to their highest timeline looks like.



I know this will resonate with users because I have been using this personally myself for the last 3-6 months with huge success on personal growth, work and business, and have tested energetic readings amongst family and friends with no additional information about them with surprising accuracy on their life and future guidance. 

I’d love your feedback on this direction and how you see it shaping into an MVP.

Thank you again for your time and guidance.



🌞 Soulstice Knowledge Base & User Manual
Reconnect. Realign. Rise.
1. About Soulstice

Soulstice is a consciousness-tech app designed to help you tune into your energy, gain clarity, and realign with your highest timeline — through the experience of a living, animated orb.

The orb acts as an interactive mirror of your energetic state. By holding, tapping, or speaking to the orb, you receive reflections and insights that guide you back into balance, purpose, and flow.

Soulstice blends intuitive design, mindful technology, and energy awareness to create a daily ritual for alignment.

2. Core Features
✨ 1. Real-Time Energy Reading (Live Orb Interaction)

Purpose:
Instantly reflect your current energy and provide gentle, actionable guidance.

How it works:

Press and hold the orb for a few seconds.

The orb reads your current energetic state and returns a three-part reflection:

Mirror Statement – A short reflection of your current energy.

Clarifying Insight – Context on what your energy is expressing or needing.

Micro-Action / Anchor – A simple step to help you realign.

Example:

“Your energy feels active, but scattered.”

“You’re carrying too many open loops — clarity will come when you focus on one thing at a time.”

“Write down your top 3 priorities today and let the rest wait.”

This feature is best used once or twice a day — ideally when you feel unfocused, uncertain, or ready to reset.

🔮 2. Highest Timeline Guidance (Ask the Orb)

Purpose:
Receive concise guidance on personal or life questions to realign with your highest timeline.

How it works:

Tap the orb and ask a question aloud or in writing, e.g., “Am I on the right path in my career?”

The orb processes your question and offers short, intuitive insights to restore clarity and trust in your path.

Example:

“Your path is aligned, but you are carrying doubt that isn’t yours.
Recognition will come when you embody the leader you already are.
Speak one sentence today as if that next version of you already exists.”

This feature helps users bridge reflection with action — ideal for moments of decision-making, self-doubt, or transition.

🌿 3. Personalised Energetic Reading (Profile Setup)

Purpose:
Offer deeper insights into your energetic makeup, life lessons, and natural alignment patterns.

How it works:

During setup, you’ll answer a few brief questions (including date of birth and self-reflection prompts).

The orb generates your Energetic Blueprint, which includes:

Core Traits & Strengths

Life Lessons & Growth Themes

Alignment Guidance – what “highest timeline” alignment looks like for you.

This reading forms your personal baseline, helping the orb deliver more accurate reflections and micro-actions over time.

5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q1: How accurate are the energy readings?

Soulstice readings are designed to mirror your present energetic focus. Accuracy comes from resonance — what feels true to you in that moment.

Q2: Can I ask the orb about specific people or events?

The orb focuses on your energy and alignment. It will always redirect guidance toward your own inner state, not others.

Q3: How often should I use Soulstice?

Once or twice daily is ideal — use it when you need clarity, grounding, or encouragement.

Q4: Do I need to believe in energy to benefit from Soulstice?

Not necessarily. Think of Soulstice as a mindfulness and reflection tool that helps you pause, centre, and act from clarity.
